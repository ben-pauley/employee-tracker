# Employee Tracker

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed Employee Tracker command line app created mostly using the inquirer and mysql JavaScript packages. The purpose of this application is to allow a company manager to keep track of their employees and departments, and make changes to all of this data, as well as retrieving more specialised information such as the total utilised budget of a particular department.

## Installation

To install this project, you may either clone this repository to a local directory, or fork the repository to your own GitHub. You must then open both the schema.sql and seed.sql files, copy the contents of these files, starting with schema.sql, into MySQL Workbench (or an SQL visual database design tool of your choice) and run them. After having installed Node.js, you must then install all the required node modules using `npm install` in the command line. Then you will be able to run the application by typing `node server.js`, where you will be able to choose from a list of options with the ability to view, change, add or remove data. . [This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LlR3pl44KqT9kNk5z_AYNa7or2TuGTJq/view) demonstrates exactly how to do all of this.

## Software Used

The development of this project was completed using Visual Studio Code, MySQL Workbench, Node.js, and mysql, console.table and inquirer packages, as well as the command line.

## Conclusion

Overall, I found the development of this application to be a fun challenge, especially completing the more difficult bonus tasks. I'd love to create more complex and intriguing MySQL queries in the future. I'd also like to develop easier ways of maintaining this code, making it more efficient and readable.
